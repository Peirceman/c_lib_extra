# Some extra libraries in c that may be usefull
## Usage
To use the libraries go into the `src` dir,
copy the corret header file in the `include` dir and if it exists, the matching header file.

## Examples
To build the examples run the build script matching your terminal/os.
It will build the examples and put the executables inside of the `out` dir.
